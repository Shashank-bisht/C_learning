// dynamic memory allocation = allocating memory in run time
// an statically allocated varibale or array has a fixed size in memory
// we have learnt to create big enough arrays to fit in our inputs but this does not seems like an optimal way to allocate memory

// memory allocation in c program
//1-code 2-static/global variable 3-stack 4-heap 

//compiler allocates some space for the stack part of the memory
//when this space gets exhausted for some reason this situation is called stack overflow

//there are a lot of limitations of stack(static memory allocation) = destroyed after function is returned

// Heap is used to store dynamic variables

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // you can know size of any file in terminal - gcc .\lect32.c ; size .\a.exe
    return 0;
}
